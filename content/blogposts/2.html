        <span class="blog-first-letter">A</span>s it goes with many user-facing projects built by large corporations,
        proper attention and care is not given to the UX design of an application before it starts getting implemented.

        So it went with Experian's AudienceView. This project’s front-end tech stack consisted of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AngularJS</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>LESS</li>
        <li>Grunt</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        In this post I will discuss how I used a mobile-first process to make this application responsive.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">Beginnings</h3>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The project's mockups were an incoherent, incomplete mess that no one was really responsible for,
        nor working on. We literally made it up as we went and built a lot of good functionality quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Halfway into the project we finally managed to land a Graphic Designer! Most of the code and markup was
        already written! Yay!
    </p>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">The Mockups</h3>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Soon she (<a target="_blank" href="http://melledujour.com">Melanie Green</a>) produced annotated mockups (similar to the image below).
    </p>
    <div id="img-container--home-page" class="blog-img-box">
        <img src="images/audienceview/home-full.png" />
        <span class="blog-img--caption">home page mockup</span>
    </div>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        My task was to create a working, responsive and mobile-ready web application out of it, salvaging the
        existing code base and UI to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The main techniques I used to make the site responsive were Media
        Queries and Bootstrap 3’s Grid System.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I would normally include responsive images, but this was an analytics app with 1 image on the main page,
        so it wasn’t very important. We had captive users who visited the app over and over.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">Media Queries</h3>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Media queries are an important tool in mobile-first driven development. They allow you to specify styles
        based on the viewport’s dimensions. Since the project used Bootstrap 3, I decided to borrow the same
        breakpoints (thanks to Nicholas Cerminara for a
        <a target="_blank" href="https://scotch.io/quick-tips/default-sizes-for-twitter-bootstraps-media-queries">great reference</a>
        that I’ve come back to many times). Below are the breakpoints I used.

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I used the mobile-first design method (<a target="_blank" href=http://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first>why mobile-first?</a>),
        which required me to make many liberties with the desktop mockups. I first divided the mockup into its
        main sections, then decided how each of the elements within would fall in a small phone-sized viewport.
    </p>
    <div id="img-container--home-main-sections" class="blog-img-box">
        <img src="images/audienceview/home-full--main-sections.png">
        <span class="blog-img--caption">home page sections</span>
    </div>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">Mobile View</h3>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        As you can see in the mobile view below, I collapsed the menu items into a “hamburger menu”.
    </p>
    <div id="img-container--phone" class="blog-img-box">
        <img src="images/audienceview/home-phone.png">
        <span class="blog-img--caption">phone view</span>
    </div>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Normally I would try to avoid hamburger menus and keep the menu items visible, but the size of the product logo
        and name was too large to include both, so I stuffed them into the hamburger.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The next thing you see is the dropdown that lets you run reports, the primary functionality of our application.
        The dropdown was just barely wide enough to display its content adequately, even after shrinking the
        button. Was a dropdown the right choice for this UI element? No. I think a typeahead type dropdown would
        probably have been easier to use, and it was certainly on my radar for the next iteration.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The next 4 buttons contained the rest of the functionality of the application, which was creating ad-hoc
        reports based on web traffic data married with population demographics data. If you look back at the
        desktop mockup, you’ll see it has the buttons side-by-side, which I stacked (a common technique for
        adapting content to mobile devices). Despite the stacking, all the buttons remained visible.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The only thing you can’t see above the fold is the image of our app inside of a monitor, which has limited
        value for repeat users.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">Large Phone + Small Tablet View</h3>
    <div id="img-container--home-first-break" class="blog-img-box">
        <img src="images/audienceview/home-first-break.png">
        <span class="blog-img--caption">first breakpoint</span>
    </div>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        As you can see here, I kept the main grid layout stacked, and used the extra width to make some content
        wider (the “Run Report” dropdown), and unstack some other content (crosstab, digital behavior, snapshots
        buttons, and the help section).
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        You might notice that the buttons are wider in the phone version than they are at this first breakpoint.
        I often use a combination of min-width and max-width in px or em’s with width in percent to let an element
        adapt to its available width while ensuring the content within doesn’t scale down to an unusable width.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I also brought out the menu items and removed the hamburger. When possible, it is a good idea to expose
        available content and functionality to the user without requiring effort on the user’s part
        (aka <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/">interaction cost</a>).
    </p>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">Large Tablet + Small Desktop View</h3>
    <div id="img-container--home-tablet" class="blog-img-box">
        <img src="images/audienceview/home-second-break.png">
        <span class="blog-img--caption">larger mobile devices</span>
    </div>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        You can see here that I finally unstacked the second main grid div. As a result, the content area for
        the first breakpoint was reduced. You will usually get increased vertical height along with this larger
        viewport, so the main functionality is still available and visible above the fold even though the buttons
        are again stacked.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blog-paragraph-header">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Although the UX design process didn’t employ a mobile-first method, I still felt like it was beneficial
        to start by approaching the implementation in a mobile-first method. I did not find it difficult to
        create a small viewport version of the app and scale up to larger screens from there.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        While it depends on the context, I would definitely lean towards using this method for creating anything
        that is public facing and informational, since usage is trending more and more towards mobile devices.
        For complicated business type web apps that require a lot of user interaction, how you decide to implement
        it should depend to a great deal on who your users are and how they will be accessing your webapp. More
        and more though, we are seeing people replacing their laptop usage with tablet usage, so making considerations
        for touch-based interfaces is going to remain very important.
